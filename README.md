# Recognizing_Hand_Written_Digits
Check Linear Separability using PCA and building a classifier using various SVM kernels. 


Train SVM classifier using sklearn digts dataset (e. from sklearn.datasets import load_digits) and then,

1. Now do some exploratory data analysis to figure out how data are linearly/non linearly
separable
2. Measure accuracy of your model using different kernels such as rbf,poly and linear.
3. Tune your model further using regularization and gamma parameters and try to come up with
highest accuracy score.
4. Use 80% of samples as training data size.
